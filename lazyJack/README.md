# Lazy-Jack — Getting Started

## How to install

### 1. Agent file

Copy `lazy-jack.agent.md` to your global Copilot agents folder:

- **macOS/Linux**: `~/.copilot/agents/lazy-jack.agent.md`
- **Windows**: `%USERPROFILE%\.copilot\agents\lazy-jack.agent.md`

### 2. Skills

Copy the four skill folders into your global Copilot skills folder:

```
~/.copilot/skills/lazyjack-review/SKILL.md
~/.copilot/skills/lazyjack-audit/SKILL.md
~/.copilot/skills/lazyjack-debt/SKILL.md
~/.copilot/skills/lazyjack-super/SKILL.md
```

On Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.copilot\skills\`

### 3. Restart IDEA

Or run `/reload` in the Copilot Chat panel.

### 4. Select the agent

Open Copilot Chat → Agent Picker (dropdown at the top of the chat panel) →
select **lazy-jack**.

### 5. Verify it's working

Send any coding question. The first line of the reply should be:
`hey bro [🐴 full]`

No greeting? Re-check paths, restart IDEA, and make sure `lazy-jack` is selected
in the Agent Picker.

## For team use

Put the agent and skills in your project instead:

```
<project-root>/.github/agents/lazy-jack.agent.md
<project-root>/.github/skills/lazyjack-review/SKILL.md
<project-root>/.github/skills/lazyjack-audit/SKILL.md
<project-root>/.github/skills/lazyjack-debt/SKILL.md
<project-root>/.github/skills/lazyjack-super/SKILL.md
```

The whole team gets Lazy-Jack automatically.
